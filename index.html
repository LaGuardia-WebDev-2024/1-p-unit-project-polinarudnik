<h3>My dog Apollo</h3>
    <p>I have a 5 year old dog named Apollo. He is a Rough collie, one of the oldest dog breeds in the world.They are long-coated dogs that were used and bred for herding sheep in Scotland. He is very playful and loves to eat. We go on long walks and enjoy nature together. </p>
